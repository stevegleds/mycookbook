"""
Takes a large file and splits into smaller files
It was created to split email csv files that Openemm rejected because of some bad email.
Some of the parts would work leaving a sub part that contained the bad data.
Enter the source and destination files and adjust the size parameter to the required size of each file
For the email import the first line needs to be 'email' so this is added before the next batch of emails are added
